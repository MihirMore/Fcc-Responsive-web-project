                        <p>Our mission since we started has stayed simple: introduce our customers to the estates we directly buy our great tasting coffee from, roast the beans with care, and make high-quality coffee more accessible through our website and cafes. We have been expanding our horizons since.</p>
    
                        <p>At Great Bean , we follow a simple set of beliefs.Transparency is much more than just where we get our beans from.</p>
                        
                        <p>A culture of constant learning is the key to always pushing coffee forward.We are consistently researching, testing and implementing best practices throughout our business to raise the bar. </p>

                            <h3>STEP ONE:<br>FARMING</h3>
                            <p>Coffee beans are actually seeds. It’s only after they have been dried, roasted and ground that they can be used to brew the humble zip.The seeds are normally planted in large shaded beds. After sprouting, the young seedlings are left to grow for a few days before moving them to individual pots with carefully formulated soils for optimal growth. </p>

                        <div id="step-two" class="col">
                            <h3>STEP TWO:<br>GRINDING</h3>
                            <p>After harvesting, cherries are processed as soon as possible to avoid spoilage. This method is a relatively new way of removing the skin from coffee cherries. It’s called ‘wet’ because it uses water to both move the coffee fruit through the process and to extract the beans. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="step-three" class="col">
                            <h3>STEP THREE:<br>ROASTING</h3>
                            <p>Unroasted coffee is also known as green coffee and such beans have all the flavours locked in them. Roasting seeks to transform the green coffee into the aromatic brown beans you buy in your favourite stores. Roasting is carried out at temperatures of approximately 550F during which time the green coffee beans are turned continuously to avoid burning.</p>

                            <h3>STEP FOUR:<br>PACKAGING</h3>
                            <p>Coffee packaging is very important, as any exposure to air could turn the coffee into a lump. This is especially the case for ground coffee, which can quickly lose its flavour if exposed to air. This is the reason why coffee is usually packed in airtight containers and should be resealed carefully when not in use.</p>
